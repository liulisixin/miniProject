## Problem Exercises and Miniproject during Module M3 of MCV 2019-20.

* The miniproject highlights the usage of different techniques we have adapted to solve a binary classification task for text vs non-text.
* Different handcrafted feature extraction techniques have been used.
* A logistic regression classifier with simple gradient descent optimization has been used for the tasks.
* Key visualizations and highlights have been added for better analysis of performance of different models.
* The other problem exercises from 1-4 help to get a better insight on how these methods work.
